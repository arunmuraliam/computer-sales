The proposed system “Computer Sales and Inventory System” is a web application to
 handle the overall process of an organization having the purchase and sales of new and old
  computer systems. This application is a multiuser system to handle the different users from many 
  locations. This application mainly concentrates the purchase of new products from reputed companies,
   handle the stock, damage and the sales.	<br><br>There are two modes for sales. One is the online 
   sales and the other is the counter sale. Similarly old products purchase and sales are also handled.
    But the old products are not sale through online, it is only through counter sale. 
   Any user from anywhere can send a sale request of old computers through online.
